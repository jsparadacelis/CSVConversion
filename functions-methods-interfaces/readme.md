# Functions, methods and interfaces

These files contains some of my experiences getting started with Golang for OO concepts. 

## Animal

Here, I created public methods for Animal structure. Just an typical exercise related with basic actions for animals like eat, move and speak. 

## Animal Poly

Poly stands for polymorphism. This is, the ability to define a same method for several type of objects. This means, that each call on an object, works differently between them.

## Bubblesort

This file just defines two methods to get an array sorted through bubblesort technique.

## Displacement

Same as Bubblesort, this just defines a method to calculate a displacement based on the physic rule.
